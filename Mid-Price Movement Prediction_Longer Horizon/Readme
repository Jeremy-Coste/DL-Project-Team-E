Mid-price movement prediction for longer horizon can be done in the following process:

1. download data from 'https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php'
2. data_preprocess_intel_1s_interval.py : 
   transform original orderbook data to data with 1s horizon mid-price movement
3. orderbook_feature_transformation_longer horizon_without fillna and timestamp.py: 
   tranform data with 1s mid-price movement to feature data without fillna and timestamp
4. Mid_Price_Prediction_INTC_1s_hrzn.ipynb:
   predict mid-price movement using LSTM
