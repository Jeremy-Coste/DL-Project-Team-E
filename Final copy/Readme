The codes under this folder are the main results of our project, which are divided into two parts:
  Part 1: features construction, data preprocessing and 2-label mid-price movement predition. 
  Part 2: market-making strategy backtesting result using predicted mid-price movement.

To get the desired result: 
  First, go to 'https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php'; 
         download 'INTC_2012-06-21_34200000_57600000_orderbook_5.csv' and 'INTC_2012-06-21_34200000_57600000_message_5.csv';
         rename them as 'INTC_OrderBook.csv' and 'INTC_message.csv' respectively;
         place both data files in the 'data' folder.
  Then,  run 'Mid-Price Movement Prediction.ipynb' and 'Strategy_Using_RNN_Predictions.ipynb' sequentially.
